Spring 2024 Chapter 1 Introduction Hi everyone! I’m Ihnwhi. It is my great pleasure to be your guest lecturer for PSY202B. The theme of my lecture is statistical modeling in psychological sciences. An essential aspect of psychological research is statistical modeling based on substantive theories. I will briefly introduce Mplus and walk you around several analytic techniques using Mplus. This GitBook is your guide such that you can easily access code for Mplus practicals. Let’s embark on this exciting learning together!

Mplus is a statistical modeling program that provides researchers with a flexible tool to analyze data Many models: regression, path analysis, factor analysis, SEM, MLM, longitudinal models, mixture model, mediation/moderation Many data: cross-sectional, longitudinal, single-/multilevel, observed/latent, incomplete Many variables: continuous, dichotomous, categorical, count Many estimator: maximum likelihood, weighted least squares, Bayesian 2.2 Syntax-based programming Commands and subcommands (https://www.statmodel.com/language.html) Examples of commands? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRRtdmu23k) TITLE, DATA, VARIABLE, ANALYSIS, MODEL, OUTPUT DEFINE, SAVEDATA, PLOT, MONTECARLO 2.3 Some tips when programming Comments can be added with exclamation marks (!) Commands should end with colon (:), and subcommands should end with semicolon (;) Syntax is not case sensitive Data should consist of numeric values, with no variable names Data and Mplus input file should be in the same directory (like an R working directory) Otherwise, be sure to specify the correct directory 2.4 Some tips about model command particularly Start with a path diagram Think of it as specifying model parameters Care to the degrees of freedom (DF) 2.5 Example. Multiple linear regression using maximum likelihood estimation 2.5.1 Model syntax ! Title command TITLE: Predicting album sales using ML multiple regression ! Data command DATA: ! When data and input file are in the same working directory FILE IS Album Sales.csv; ! Subcommands should end with ; ! When data and input file are in the different working directory ! FILE IS c:\\desktop\\different folder\\Album Sales.csv; ! Variable command VARIABLE: ! Column names (i.e., ALL variable names) NAMES ARE adverts sales airplay attract; ! Variables that will be used in our analysis USEVARIABLES ARE adverts sales airplay; ! Analysis command ANALYSIS: ESTIMATOR IS ML; ! This is the default ! Model command MODEL: ! Let&#39;s predict sales using adverts and airplay ! We regress sales on adverts and airplay sales ON adverts airplay; ! If you do not specify variances of and covariances between predictors ! degrees of freedom (DF) are not correct ! Variances of exogenous variable adverts airplay; ! Covariances between exogenous variable adverts WITH airplay; ! Output command OUTPUT: TECH1 SAMPSTAT STDYX; ! TECH1 to understand which parameters are being estimated ! SAMPSTAT to check sample descriptive statistics ! STDYX to standardize Y (i.e., DV) and X (i.e., IV) 2.5.2 Part of the output file MODEL RESULTS Two-Tailed Estimate S.E. Est./S.E.
