Spring 2024 Chapter 1 Introduction Hi everyone! I’m Ihnwhi. It is my great pleasure to be your guest lecturer for PSY202B. The theme of my lecture is statistical modeling in psychological sciences. An essential aspect of psychological research is statistical modeling based on substantive theories. It is thus important to use statistical software for accurate modeling to reach the research conclusion. I will briefly introduce Mplus (Part 1) and HLM (Part 2) and walk you around several analytic techniques using statistical software. This GitBook is your guide such that you can easily access code for Mplus and HLM practicals. Are you ready? Let’s get it on!

Why called Mplus? Mplus is a statistical modeling program that provides researchers with a flexible tool to analyze data Many models: regression, path analysis, factor analysis, SEM, MLM, longitudinal models, mixture model, mediation/moderation Many data: cross-sectional, longitudinal, single-/multilevel, observed/latent, incomplete Many variables: continuous, dichotomous, categorical, count Many estimator: maximum likelihood, weighted least squares, Bayesian 2.2 Syntax-based programming Commands and subcommands (https://www.statmodel.com/language.html) Examples of commands? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeRRtdmu23k) We will be ‘mostly’ using TITLE, DATA, VARIABLE, ANALYSIS, MODEL, OUTPUT commands But we will also be often using DEFINE, SAVEDATA, PLOT, MONTECARLO commands 2.3 Some tips when programming Comments can be added with exclamation marks (!) Commands should end with colon (:), and subcommands should end with semicolon (;) Syntax is not case sensitive Data should consist of numeric values, with no variable names Data and Mplus input file should be in the same directory (like an R working directory) Otherwise, be sure to specify the correct directory 2.4 Some tips about model command particularly Start with a path diagram Think of it as specifying model parameters Care to the degrees of freedom (DF) 2.5 Example: Multiple linear regression using maximum likelihood estimation 2.5.1 Model syntax !

They are thus to conduct a path analysis to examine the interrelationships between the variables. According to the substantive theory, depression (depress) is predicted by anxiety (anxiety), and hostile behavior (hostile) is predicted by depression and distress. So here, depression is a mediating variable between anxiety and hostility. Two exogenous variables are anxiety and distress. Use the mmpi.csv dataset. 3.2 Main questions Draw a path diagram.

Our substantive theory suggests that sensation seeking (senseek), Machiavellianism (totmach), powerlessness (totpower), social monitoring (totsms), and faith (totfaith) measure the one underlying latent construct: being manipulative. We are thus to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis that measures manipulativeness by the five measures. Use the mmpi.csv dataset. 4.2 Main questions Draw a path diagram. Write Mplus syntax. !

"],["structural-equation-modeling.html", "Chapter 5 Structural Equation Modeling 5.1 Research scenario 5.2 Main questions 5.3 Bonus questions", " Chapter 5 Structural Equation Modeling 5.1 Research scenario Based on the findings on the impact of anxiety and distress (Coward et al., 2024) and manipulative behavior (Patel et al., 2024), Ihnwhi is interested in modeling the interrelationships between manipulativeness, anxiety, and distress. In particular, the research aim is to predict being manipulative using anxiety (anxiety) and distress (distress) via structural equation modeling. For the sake of convenience, you can only use the three following variables to measure manipulativeness: sensation seeking (senseek), Machiavellianism (totmach), and social monitoring (totsms).
