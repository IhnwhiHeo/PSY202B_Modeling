# Introduction

Hi everyone! I'm Ihnwhi.

It is my great pleasure to be your guest lecturer for PSY202B. The theme of my lecture is statistical modeling in psychological sciences. An essential aspect of psychological research is statistical modeling based on substantive theories. I will briefly introduce Mplus and walk you around several analytic techniques using Mplus. This GitBook is your guide such that you can easily access code for Mplus practicals. Let's embark on this exciting learning together!
